## üöÄ Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

### Quick Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

#### Step 1: Create a New Space
1. Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
2. Click "Create new Space"
3. Choose a name for your space
4. Select "Streamlit" as the SDK
5. Choose visibility (Public/Private)

#### Step 2: Upload Files
Upload these files to your space:
- `app.py` (main application)
- `agents.py` (agent definitions)
- `tasks.py` (task definitions) 
- `tools.py` (tool configurations)
- `app_utils.py` (utility functions)
- `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
- `README.md` (documentation)

#### Step 3: Configure Application
The application will automatically deploy. Users will need to enter their API keys when using the app.

#### Step 4: Success!
Your Elite AI Career Intelligence System will be live at:
`https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME`

### Alternative: Manual Upload via Git

```bash
# Clone your space repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
cd YOUR_SPACE_NAME

# Copy application files
cp /path/to/multi-agent-job-application-crew/* .

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy multi-agent-job-application-crew"
git push
```

### Expected Performance
- **Build time**: 2-3 minutes for complete system initialization
- **Memory usage**: ~1GB for full multi-agent processing
- **Response time**: 45-90 seconds per comprehensive job application optimization

### API Keys for Hugging Face

When deploying on Hugging Face Spaces, users will be prompted to enter their API keys directly in the application interface:
- OpenAI API Key (required for elite AI agent intelligence)
- Serper API Key (required for comprehensive web search and job analysis functionality)

The system will not operate without these keys, ensuring users provide their own secure credentials.
